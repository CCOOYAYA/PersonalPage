							<p>Hello I'm <strong>Cai Yingcheng</strong>, You could find my computer programming samples <a href="https://github.com/CCOOYAYA/CodeSamples">here</a>. I uploaded two projects I made in college and one of it is quite complex. Also there are details in the <strong>readme</strong> file. </p>
							<p>In fact, as a non art specialist, computer programming is more familiar to me. Actually I made a small game with Unreal Engine 4, but unfortunately due to the size of the uploaded file, I can't show you all the elements but I do upload some screensnaps and some blueprints. Follow the link <a href="https://github.com/CCOOYAYA/UE4Project_Light">here</a>. If you really want to see the full game, contact me by sending me an e-mail, the e-mail address is in the third section.</p>
							<p>Writing sample is also posted in Github, you may find it <a href="https://github.com/CCOOYAYA/CodeSamples">here</a>.</p>

										<br><strong>Tag</strong>	News; Future Work; China
										<br><strong>Abstract</strong>	Players can choose to be either good or evil, but we don’t think that games should give players this choice
										<br><strong>From</strong>	Game Developer
										<br>The news shows the restrictions for the game industry in China, as a future game developer, I cannot blame the country but need to think more about what game can bring us and let us know. I also select a Serious Game course on spring semester due to this news.

										<br><strong>Tag</strong>	 Postmortem; Indie game; Pixel Game
										<br><strong>Abstract</strong>	The summarization of a game called Loop Hero
										<br><strong>From</strong>	Game Developer
										<br>Because I was in a team working on a platformer in the form of pixel arts. So, the experience from this team is precious for us. They share many suggestions, the most important one is test in small scale, our team also conducted play test, that really helped a lot. However, they have made a lot of mistakes, like chaotic workflow. Actually our team is also suffering due to this.

										<br><strong>Tag</strong>	 Postmortem; Roguelike Game
										<br><strong>Abstract</strong>	The summarization of a game called Children of Morta
										<br><strong>From</strong>	Game Developer
										<br>This postmortem is from a much bigger studio with a lot of people, so the production is much pretty than most of the indie games. In this postmortem, I can see the same mistakes that happen on indie game developer, but also some more complex problems. Also this article is the inspiration for our team to make a pixel game.

									<p><a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1024307/Level-Design-Workshop-Designing-Celeste">Level Design Workshop: Designing Celeste</a>
										<br><strong>Tag</strong>	 Postmortem; Platformer; Level Design
										<br><strong>Abstract</strong>	The level design experience from a game called Celeste. This talk touches on a range of topics through the tools and process of designing 300+ hardcore platformer stages for 'Celeste', arranging the sprawling area maps that make up the mountain, and weaving story elements through its game world.
										<br><strong>From</strong>	GDC Vault
										<br>Theoretically this is not an article, but I must include it here because it is like the Bible in the area of platformer. Celeste, a indie game was nominated as the best game of 2018. In this video, Matt shares many techniques when designing the levels in Celeste like multiple approaches in different ways, give each level a short story… After watching this video, I finally decided to make a platformer game.

										<br><strong>From</strong>	Game Developer
										<br>Dungeon clawer is the type of game our team wanted to finalize at the very beginning, but after we finished reading this postmortem, all of us thought this is not interesting and not suitable for mobile devices. In the end, we gave up this idea and turned to platformer.

										<br>This book is about the blueprints in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), which is the most difficult and complex part in UE4. I haven’t finished this book yet, but I have mastered the basic knowledge of UE4 and now I am working on our team’s game.
